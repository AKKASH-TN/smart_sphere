# Voice Command Integration - Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I've successfully integrated Whisper AI speech-to-text functionality into your SmartSphere app!

## 🎯 What Was Added

### New Files Created:
1. **`lib/services/speech_service.dart`** - Handles audio recording and Whisper API transcription
2. **`lib/services/voice_command_processor.dart`** - Processes transcribed text into commands
3. **`VOICE_COMMANDS.md`** - Complete documentation for the voice feature

### Updated Files:
1. **`lib/screens/home_dashboard.dart`** - Added voice command dialog with recording UI
2. **`lib/screens/chatbot_screen.dart`** - Added support for initial voice messages
3. **`pubspec.yaml`** - Added required packages (record, path_provider, permission_handler)

## 🎤 How It Works

1. User taps the microphone FAB button
2. Dialog appears with "Start" button
3. User taps "Start" → button turns RED and recording begins
4. User speaks their command
5. User taps "Stop" → audio is sent to Whisper API
6. Whisper transcribes the audio to text
7. VoiceCommandProcessor interprets the command
8. Command is executed automatically!

## 🗣️ Supported Voice Commands

### Device Control:
- ✅ "Turn on light" / "Turn off light"
- ✅ "Turn on fan" / "Turn off fan"
- ✅ "Switch on/off [device]"

### Navigation:
- ✅ "Open devices" / "Show devices"
- ✅ "Open energy" / "Show analytics"
- ✅ "Go to home"

### Chatbot:
- ✅ "Ask chatbot [question]"
- ✅ "Help me with [topic]"
- ✅ Any unrecognized command → forwarded to AI chatbot

### Status:
- ✅ "Check status" / "What's the status"

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Recording**: `record` package (v5.2.1)
- **API**: Whisper AI via HuggingFace (`https://jeevesh256-whisper-endpoint.hf.space`)
- **Format**: WAV audio, 16kHz, mono
- **Processing**: Natural language command interpretation

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Animated Recording Indicator**: Blue when ready, Red when listening
- **Real-time Status**: Shows "Listening..." during recording
- **Smart Feedback**: Confirmation messages for each action
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

## 📱 Demo Script for Hackathon

### Show the judges:

1. **"Turn on the light"** → Light card turns ON
2. **"Turn off fan"** → Fan card turns OFF
3. **"Check status"** → Dialog shows both device statuses
4. **"Open chatbot and ask about energy saving"** → Opens AI chatbot with the question
5. **"Show analytics"** → Navigates to Energy Analytics screen

## 🚀 Next Steps to Test

```bash
# Run the app
flutter run -d windows

# Try saying:
- "Turn on light"
